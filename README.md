# My_GPT
Document Chat with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
MyGPT is a lightweight, self-hostable PDF chatbot that
combines Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, and OCR to let users chat with documents. User uploaded PDFs are converted into a
searchable vectorstore, enabling them to engage in contextual conversations. Each chat session maintains its own memory and
can be exported as a PDF conversation log.
